Project Owners are the technical authority for a project in the Schrödinger Hat community. They *MUST* have demonstrated both good judgement and responsibility towards the health of that project. Project Owners *MUST* set technical direction and make or approve design decisions for their project - either directly or through delegation of these responsibilities.

# Inactive members

_Members are continuously active contributors in the community._

A core principle in maintaining a healthy community is encouraging active participation. It is inevitable that people's focuses will change over time and they are not expected to be actively contributing forever.

However, being a member of Schrödinger Hat comes with an elevated set of permissions. These capabilities should not be used by those that are not familiar with the current state of the community.

Therefore members with an extended period away from the community with no activity inside of it will be removed and will be required to go through the community membership process again after re-familiarizing themselves with the current state.
