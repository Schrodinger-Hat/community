#  Schrödinger Hat Community

Welcome to the Schrödinger Hat community!

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Schrödinger Hat community - improving docs, improving code, giving talks etc.

## Communicating

The communication page lists communication channels like chat, issues, conferences, etc.

## Contribute

A first step to contributing is to pick a project. Start joining the Discord server and have a chat with the other folks.

Each repo will often have a set of "help wanted" or "good first issue" issues that can help new contributors get involved.

## Membership

We encourage all contributors to become members. We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers and code owners. Learn more about requirements and responsibilities in our Community Membership page.
